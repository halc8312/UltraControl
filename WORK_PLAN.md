# UltraControl Development Work Plan

This document outlines the development plan for merging `bolt.new-any-llm-main`, `devin-clone-mvp`, and `OpenHands-main` into a single, cohesive application named `UltraControl`.

## Phase 1: UI Foundation and Stabilization

**Goal:** Build a stable user interface foundation by adapting components from `bolt.new-any-llm-main`.

- **Task 1.1:** Resolve all compilation and runtime errors in the `ultracontrol-app` caused by the initial component migration.
- **Task 1.2:** Replace Remix-specific APIs (`loader`, `action`, `Link`, etc.) with standard Vite/React equivalents.
- **Task 1.3:** Integrate and configure a state management library (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, or Nanostores) to handle UI state.
- **Task 1.4:** Finalize the core application layout, including the header, main chat/workbench area, and side panels.
- **Task 1.5:** Ensure all basic UI components are rendering correctly with the proper styles (UnoCSS and SCSS).

## Phase 2: Core Feature Integration (`bolt.new-any-llm-main`)

**Goal:** Integrate the core functionalities of `bolt.new-any-llm-main`, enabling AI-driven code generation within the browser.

- **Task 2.1:** Port the backend logic for LLM communication from Cloudflare Functions to a backend solution compatible with Vite (e.g., Vite's dev server middleware or a separate Node.js server).
- **Task 2.2:** Implement the UI for selecting different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.).
- **Task 2.3:** Integrate the WebContainers API to allow file system operations and command execution from within `ultracontrol-app`.
- **Task 2.4:** Establish the end-to-end flow: send a prompt from the chat UI, process it through the backend LLM service, and have the generated code reflect in the WebContainer environment.

## Phase 3: Agentic Capabilities Integration (`OpenHands-main`)

**Goal:** Incorporate the autonomous agent capabilities from `OpenHands-main`.

- **Task 3.1:** Design and implement a method to interface with the `OpenHands-main` Python core from the `ultracontrol-app` (e.g., via a dedicated Python backend API).
- **Task 3.2:** Integrate the agent's autonomous features (command execution, web browsing) into the `UltraControl` UI.
- **Task 3.3:** Develop a UI to allow users to assign tasks to the agent and monitor its progress in real-time.
- **Task 3.4:** Investigate and implement a strategy for allowing the `OpenHands` agent to interact with the `bolt` WebContainer environment, enabling a unified workspace.

## Phase 4: Feature Refinement and Final Integration

**Goal:** Polish the application by incorporating the best features from `devin-clone-mvp` and ensuring all parts work together seamlessly.

- **Task 4.1:** Integrate the Monaco Editor to provide a superior code editing experience.
- **Task 4.2:** Port useful UI/UX elements from `devin-clone-mvp`, such as the file tree explorer and other modern UI components, into `ultracontrol-app`.
- **Task 4.3:** Conduct a full review of the integrated features to ensure they function cohesively as a single tool.
- **Task 4.4:** Refactor and optimize the entire application, removing redundant code, unused dependencies, and improving performance.
- **Task 4.5:** Document the final project structure and establish clear instructions for building and running `UltraControl`.
